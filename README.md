# Getting Started with Create React App

This project is a proof of concept for an Azure Web App with an Azure Functions backend. When you send a request, a consumption-based Azure Functions App hits the Free Weather API and returns the current conditions to the client. This app also uses Azure App Insights to monitor which cities are requested. 

## Get the weather!
